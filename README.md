## Abstract
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly impacted communication systems, with machine learning models increasingly replacing traditional signal processing techniques. However, existing AI-driven solutions in this domain are typically designed for specific tasks, requiring large amounts of supervised data and limiting their scalability. In contrast, foundation models-large-scale deep learning models trained on diverse, unsupervised data-have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities in natural language processing, computer vision, and scientific computing. This tutorial introduces the concept of a foundation model for communication systems: a transformer-based, multimodal architecture capable of learning universal representations of communication data. We will discuss key challenges in designing such a model, including tokenization, positional embedding, multimodality, feature normalization, and feature size variations. Additionally, we will present a simulation-based approach for training foundation models using unsupervised wireless data, followed by an empirical evaluation on illustrative tasks such as channel estimation, Doppler spectrum prediction, and precoder selection. By the end of this tutorial, attendees will gain insights into the principles, methodologies, and applications of foundation models in wireless communications. This session is tailored for researchers and engineers interested in 6G, AI-driven network automation, and data-driven optimization of communication systems.
